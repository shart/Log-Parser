# Chat Log Cleaner
---
<p>This project was created and will be maintained with the intent to strip elements from a chat log and either format for posting on the web, or in a plain text format. It is a work in progress and may or may not work for anyone else besides myself.</p>
<p>Suggestions for improvements are welcome once it gets to a working state.</p>
<p>Currently it works with individual files, but the aim is to be able to process all files in a directory. It's set up to use Windows Forms for ease of use.</p>
